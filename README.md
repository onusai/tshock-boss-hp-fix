Modifies boss HP scaling. Ignores dead players and players on other teams 

By default, scaling will be based on the amount of alive players on the team nearest to the boss when it spawns

If you want scaling to ignore teams and count all alive players on server, edit the config file `tshock/BossHPFix.json` and set `UseTeamPlayerCount` to `false`
